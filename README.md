[View the Report](./Report1.pdf)  | [View the Python Notebook](./Diabetes_Risk_Predictive_Model.ipynb)

**Summary:** Built a multivariate logistic regression model in Python using CDC diabetes health indicators to predict diabetes risk based on age, BMI, and physical activity.  
**Key Results:**  
- Achieved **86% accuracy** in the unweighted model, highly effective for identifying non-diabetic individuals.  
- Applied class weighting to improve recall for diabetic cases from **0.03 to 0.76**, trading overall accuracy for sensitivity.  
**Tools:** Python, pandas, scikit-learn, statsmodels, matplotlib
