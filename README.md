# **Tace Harris**  

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! I'm Tace Harris, a Political Science major with a minor in Quantitative Methods in the Social Sciences at The University of Michigan. My work focuses on the intersection of public policy and data analysis, and I have a deep intrest in health related issues. I have experience in research, statistical analysis, and working with big data.

## **Projects**  
**These projects were created as part of my minor coursework and have been modified for this portfolio**
### 1. Diabetes Risk Predictive Model  
[View the Report](./Report1.pdf)  | [View the Python Notebook](./Diabetes_Risk_Predictive_Model.ipynb)

**Summary:** Built a multivariate logistic regression model in Python using CDC diabetes health indicators to predict diabetes risk based on age, BMI, and physical activity.  
**Key Results:**  
- Achieved **86% accuracy** in the unweighted model, highly effective for identifying non-diabetic individuals.  
- Applied class weighting to improve recall for diabetic cases from **0.03 to 0.76**, trading overall accuracy for sensitivity.  
**Tools:** Python, pandas, scikit-learn, statsmodels, matplotlib
  
## 2.Geospatial Analysis of Crime, Neighborhoods, and Schools in Chicago  
[View the Report](./Geospatial_Data_Project.pdf) | [View the R Code](./Project1.R)

**Summary:**  
Conducted a geospatial analysis of crime distribution across Chicago with a focus on identifying high-risk areas near schools. Used city-provided crime, school location, zip code, and community area data to map risk patterns and assess property crime proximity to schools.

**Key Methods & Tools:**  
- **Tools:** R, RStudio, `sf` package, `ggplot2`  
- **Data Sources:** City of Chicago crime data & school location datasets  
- Created shapefiles for mapping, categorized crime rates by zip code and community area  
- Applied buffer zones (0.5 and 1 mile) to assess property crime incidents near schools  
- Generated thematic maps and bar charts ranking schools by nearby property crime incidents

**Key Findings:**  
- **Crime Concentration:** High-risk zip codes cluster in central Chicago, while community-level mapping shows pockets of high crime in the north-central and south-central areas.  
- **School Risk Zones:** Northwest Chicago has a dense cluster of schools with high property crime within 0.5 miles; Bouchet School had the highest within 1 mile, Ombudsman-Northwest High School the lowest.  
- **Disparities in Crime:** Crime distribution is highly uneven — the highest-crime community experiences **46x more incidents** than the lowest, and the highest-crime zip code sees **151x more incidents** than the lowest.  
- **Measurement Differences:** Some areas appear low-risk by community boundaries but high-risk by zip code, highlighting the importance of scale in crime analysis.
